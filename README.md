A simple PHP library that simplifies cryptographical hashing. It provides an
object-oriented interface to a variety of hashing methods.

## Requirements

* PHP `8.1`, `8.2` or PHP `8.3` (recommended)

## Installation

Installation is done via Composer: `composer require angrybytes/hash`.

## Components

### Hash

`AngryBytes\Hash\Hash` is the main hasher class and acts as a helper wrapper
around hashers (i.e. `AngryBytes\Hash\HasherInterface` implementations).

Some of the main features of this component:

* Hash strings and/or passwords.
* Create short hashes (e.g. used for identification).
* Compare strings/hashes using a time-safe method.
* Verify a string against a hash using the configured hasher.

### Hashers

This library comes with a set of hashers to be utilized by this hash component (or
to be used on their own):

 * `AngryBytes\Hash\Hasher\BlowFish`
 * `AngryBytes\Hash\Hasher\MD5`
 * `AngryBytes\Hash\Hasher\Password`

### HMAC

`AngryBytes\Hash\HMAC` can be used to generate
[HMAC's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code)
for string messages.
